##
# Folder model. Each instance of this class represents a single folder to which a user can associate feeds.
#
# Each folder belongs to a single user, and each user can have many folders (one-to-many relationship).
#
# Each folder can be associated with many feeds, and each feed can be associated with many folders (many-to-many relationship,
# through the feed_folders table).
#
# A relationship is also established between Folder and Entry models, through the Feed model. This enables us to retrieve
# all entries for all feeds inside a folder.
#
# The title field is mandatory. As it is introduced by the user, it is sanitized before saving in the database.
#
# A given user cannot have two folders with the same title. Folders with the same title are allowed as long as they
# belong to different users.
