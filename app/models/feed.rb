# Feed model. Each instance of this model represents a single feed (Atom, RSS...) to which a user is suscribed.
#
# Many users can be suscribed to a single feed, and a single user can be suscribed to many feeds (many-to-many
# relationship).
#
# Each user can have many entries.
#
# Each feed, identified by its fetch_url, can be present at most once in the database. Different feeds can have the same
# title, as long as they have different fetch_url.
#
# Attributes of the model:
# - title
# - fetch_url (URL to fetch the feed XML)
# - url (URL to which the user will be linked; usually the website that originated this feed)
#
# Both title and fetch_url are mandatory. url and fetch_url are validated with the following regex:
#   /\Ahttps?:\/\/.+\..+\z/
#
# Title, fetch_url and url are sanitized (with ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper) before validation; this is,
# before saving/updating each instance in the database.
